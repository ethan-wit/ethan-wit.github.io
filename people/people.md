### 1789-1864

Remarkable impact on global economic productivity through his invention of the Roberts Loom (1820) and the self-acting mule (1825, 1830). A mule spins fibers, such as cotton, into yarn. A loom threads yarn into cloth. The Roberts Loom "significantly increased the reliability and speed of the weaving process" [1](https://historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/textile-mills-lancashire-legacy/textile-mills-lancashire-legacy/), and sold over 4,000 units per year by 1825 [2](https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=4682). It's considered the first power loom that was more commercially viable than the wooden hand loom. It was made of cast iron and powered by water. The self-acting mule automated the entire spinning process and was powered by steam. It's known as his greatest innovation. Roberts effectively automated the production (excluding agriculture) of one of the four basic needs: food, water, shelter, **clothing**. William Henry Bailey on Roberts: "Robertsâ€™s chief power lay, I should say, in his marvellous memory and his large capacity for combining forces. In his way through life, nothing bearing on the application of steam or machinery escaped his attention, and he was thus enabled to bring to bear a wide experience and a vast array of well-digested facts."

### 1912-1982

According to Varian, Shephard gave cost functions "the most systematic treatment" in his *Cost and Production Functions* (1953) and *Theory of Cost and Production Functions* (1970) [4](https://www.amazon.com/Microeconomic-Analysis-Third-Hal-Varian/dp/0393957357). Shephard is best known for [Shephard's Lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shephard%27s_lemma) and the Shephard Duality Theorem. Per his obituary, "Shephard's pioneering work is the creation of a modern theory of production, the success of which grew out of his practical insights into real world problems. He pioneered the expansion of traditional production theory to include more aspects than labor, capital, and raw materials. His work has been applied to describe and improve processes from consumer goods production to shipyard operations."

### 1866-1959

John C held 55 patents, and started the Lincoln Electric Company in 1895. LEC was initially a vehicle for John C to manufacture and sell his electric motor designs, however, the company now operates mainly in the arc welding machinery industry. By 1943, LEC captured half the US and a quarter of the world arc welding market. Lincoln Electric implemented numerous innovative policies in corporate finance and management. The most notable was the piecework plan implemented in 1914, whereby workers in the plant were paid for each unit of output they produced. The piece rate was inversely proprotional to the time it took a worker to produce one unit. This was put in place to incentivize workers to increase the returns from labor, holding capital constant.
