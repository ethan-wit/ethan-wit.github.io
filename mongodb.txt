index
	- forces existence (if it's not a sparse index) and uniqueness of values (null if doesn't exist) for a particular key in a collection
	- allows unambiguous query of said keys
	- mongo automatically creates an index on the _id key (similar to row_id in sqlite), but more indexes can be created
