Python Flask app AWS Elastic Beanstalk (EB) Console Deployment Directions

1. Develop Flask app
	- Create either conda environment or virtualenv; install dependencies
	- Use waitress as WSGI production server, as Flask development server cannot handle high traffic and is insecure
	- Name application "application.py" as this is what EB searches for by default
	
2. Declare Python dependencies
	- pip freeze > requirements.txt

3. Configure
	- Make .ebextensions folder
	- Make python.config file within folder, with the following specs:
	
	options_settings:
    		"aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python":
        		WSGIPath: application:application

4. Zip directory
	- Control-click app, requirements.txt, and .ebextensions 
	- Compress above items into zip file

5. Upload zip file to Elastic Beanstalk console
