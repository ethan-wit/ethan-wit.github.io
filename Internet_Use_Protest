This paper investigates the relationship between internet usage and protest violence in Western nations. Study 1 builds a longitudinal regression model that predicts a nation’s level of political violence. Within a sample of 12 Western nations, I find that a nation’s number of internet users significantly predicts its number of quarterly violent protests. Study 2 proposes an experiment which measures the change in acceptability of protest violence for a sample of university students who are given the treatment of using a social internet technology, Twitter.
