Measures the impact of the New York City Department of Education lifting their electronic device ban on schools' academic performance. In consequence of studying the lifting of the device ban, I estimate the effect of the introduction of unstructured electronic device use on academic performance. A quasi-experimental interrupted time series analysis is employed to determine if school state exam passing rates were significantly affected by the lifting of the ban.
